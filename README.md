# colorConverter

Created for my fellow fahsion designers and graphic designers alike. When using various softwares to create art there can be a mix and match amonf the many types of color codes selected.
This program is created to assist in converting color code from HEX to RGB and RGB to HEX.

It will prompt a user for their starting color type, asks for their desired color type that they would like to convert. Upon clicking convert the user will get a preview of their color and the converted color code.
